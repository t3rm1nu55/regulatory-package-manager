## Quick Start

1. **Read the Proposal**: Start with [PROPOSAL.md](PROPOSAL.md) for the complete vision
2. **Review Examples**: Check the `examples/` directory for worked examples (placeholders for now)
3. **Technical Deep Dive**: Explore `architecture/` for implementation details
4. **Business Case**: Review `business/` for revenue and market analysis

## Key Innovation

We're applying Maven's package management patterns to regulatory documents, creating:
- **Version control** for regulations
- **Dependency management** between related documents
- **Bill of Materials (BOM)** for compliance packages
- **Analysis layer** for extracting obligations and mappings

## Next Steps

1. **Team Review**: Review the proposal with stakeholders
2. **Complete Examples**: Build out the worked examples with detailed implementations
3. **Prototype**: Build MVP with EMIR as first regime
4. **Validate**: Test with pilot customers

## Technology Stack

- **Maven**: Package management
- **Nexus OSS**: Repository manager
- **PostgreSQL**: Metadata storage
- **Neo4j**: Graph relationships
- **Elasticsearch**: Full-text search
- **Python/FastAPI**: API layer
- **MCP Server**: LLM integration

## Investment Required

- **Development**: 240 hours (~$36,000)
- **Infrastructure**: $0 (open source)
- **Timeline**: 6-8 weeks to MVP

## Expected Return

- **Year 1**: $1M revenue (10 clients)
- **Year 2**: $5M revenue (50 clients)
- **Year 3**: $20M revenue (200 clients)
